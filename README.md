EZ Investments

With this project we want to enable users to be able to take control of their investments and make informed financial decisions

- AUTOMATED PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION: A PAGE WHERE USERS CAN INPUT THEIR PREFERENCES AND BE PRESENTED WITH AN OPTIMIZED PORTFOLIO
- MANUAL PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION: A PAGE TO ENABLE USERS TO EXPLORE, MODIFY, AND CREATE THEIR OWN PORTFOLIO
- EXPLORE MARKET TRENDS: SERIES OF PAGES WHERE USERS CAN EXPLORE THE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS THAT THE EZ INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OFFERS

# Technologies Used
- Pandas
- MongoDB
- Html, CSS, JS, D3
- ChartJs, Plotly

# Data Aquisition
We acquired all the stock information from Rapid API.

https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yahoo-finance1

# Data Cleaning
Acquired JSON data was transformed using Python and Pandas
Removed irrelevant fields
Added date field with specific format converted from epoch time
Rounded the closing stock prices to 2 decimal places
Cleaned data was saved to a file

# Data Calculations
Various statistical functions were used to calculate Annual Volatility, Annual Return, Daily Volatility and Last 3 month Return for each of the investments
Daily returns and asset covariance was calculated and then portfolio return and volatility was computed

# Storage & Retrieval

MongoDB and PyMongo library were used to store the clean json files.

Each investment was saved as a separate collection. The stock computations were saved in respective collections.

Flask and PyMongo were used to retrieve the data from MongoDB and a local web server was created with support for different API calls 

D3 javascript library was used to get data from Flask and populate the visual elements in HTML

# Visualizations

Website site was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap (Template from: https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-admin-2)

# New Library

The new library we used is 'chart.js' (https://www.chartjs.org/) -- 

# Limitations

There were only 8 investments chosen to study

Historical Data was limited to the beginning of 2020
